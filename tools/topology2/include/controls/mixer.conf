#
# Mixer control
#
# Usage: this component can be used by instantiating it in the parent object. i.e.
#
# 	Object.mixer."N" {
#		pipeline_id	1
#		index	0
#	}
#
# Where N is the unique instance number for the buffer object within the same alsaconf node.
# The mixer control object should also include the ops, channels and tlv objects.

<include/controls/common.conf>

Class.Control."mixer" {
	#
	# The Mixer object name would be constructed using the pipeline_id and index arguments.
	# For ex: "mixer.1.1" or "mixer.10.2" etc.
	# The actual mixer control name as seen by alsamixer would be provided by the parent
	#"pga" object that instantiates the mixer.
